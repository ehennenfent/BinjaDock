binja_toolbar is a fork of BinjaDock that adds a toolbar to Binary Ninja and allows you to easily add buttons to it. You probably won't have a reason to use this as it is, but other plugin developers may find it makes it easy for them to effectively incorporate their code into the UI.

## Installation
Inside your [Binary Ninja plugins folder](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/tree/master/python/examples#loading-plugins), just run `git clone https://github.com/ehennenfent/binja_toolbar.git`

## Requirements
* PyQt5
* Binary Ninja

binja_toolbar has only been tested on Ubuntu 16.04. You are encouraged to file a pull request or open an issue for any incompatibilities.
